# Winter 2020/2021 Portfolio Projects


# Introduction
This repository is another portfolio project of the Winter 2020/2021 season. This portfolio will be split into two projects that include analyses and presentations of data. These projects will display my understanding of the skill learned in Bellevue University's Data Science course. Please enjoy looking through the projects.



# Abstract
The following areas of this portfolio repository will discuss and explain the objectives of the projects. With this in mind, it is time to talk about the parameters of these projects. Here are the parameters of each of the projects that will include the item below. 


• Report/White Paper

APA references

Summarize your business problem/hypothesis

Walk through your method 

5-8 Pages. 

Up to 3 Illustrations @ ¼ page each. 

Up to 1 Illustration @ ½ page. 

PDF 1 Appendix 



• Presentation

Can be in PowerPoint, Prezi or any other presentation tool. You can be creative here and use other tools like blogs, dashboards, etc. but you must have audio 

Presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes – and a minimum of 10 minutes (Remember, these are going on your portfolio, the goal is to gain the attention of potential employers.) 



• Q&A

You must submit 10 potential questions you would receive in a presentation along with your answers in a PDF. 

• Jupyter Notebook or link to your GitHub with your code/dataset.



# Summary of Skills
I used the python environment to perform my exploratory data analysis. I also used the Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy packages and Micosoft's Power BI application for these projects.

# Preview

## Project One 
![Preview of the Scatter Plot created from this project.](https://github.com/micgonzalez/DSC690-Winter-2020-Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/project_one/dsc_690_insurance_polynomial_y_pred_and_test_data_scatterplot.png)

This scatter plot was created from this project to convey my findings from the polynomial model to the public.


## Project Two

This was created from this project to convey my findings to the public.



# Findings
Each of these projects are domain agnostic, data agnostic, and method agnostic. This means that you can pull data from any domain, analyze it using whatever method you deem worthy, and use data that already exists in any form.

## Project One
Developing and testing three predictive models, the accuracy of the models were good. Only two of the three models had higher accuracy rates. The accuracy rate could have been higher if the dataset had more data. Other than that, this is a great outcome for this project. 

## Project Two
Developing and testing three predictive models, the accuracy of two models was fantastic. The logistic regression model and the support vector machine model were the best models that had good accuracy rates.


# Challenges

## Project One
The only issue is with this dataset is that it has a limited amount of data. This will hinder the scalability of this predictive model in the future of this project.

## Project Two
The only issue is with this dataset, I had to change some variables to categorical data types to make it easier to with on. This was a small issue for this project. Including more datasets from different sources will likely help from dealing with other issues.


# Conclusion

## Project One
The focus of this project was to see if it is possible to use health insurance data to predict insurance rates based on features. The Polynomial Regression model was the best model that has had the highest accuracy rate. The Polynomial Regression model’s accuracy was 85% and it will be able to predict accurate insurance rates. 

## Project Two
The focus of this project was to see if it is possible to predict if a person would have a cardiovascular disease based on features. From the look of the accuracy rate of the naïve bayes classifier. The rate is not on the same level as the other two models. To be honest, 58%  accuracy rate is not bad, but when comparing to the other models. The logistic regression model and the support vector machine model was 72% and with more time the accuracy rate could be higher.
