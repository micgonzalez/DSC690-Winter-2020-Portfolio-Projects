# DSC690 Winter 2020 Portfolio Projects


# Introduction
This repository is a portfolio of DSC 690 projects for Winter 2020. This portfolio will be split into two projects that include analyses and presentations of data. These projects will display my understanding of the skill learned in Bellevue University's Data Science course. Please enjoy looking through the projects.



# Abstract
The following areas of this portfolio repository will discuss and explain the objectives of the projects. With this in mind, it is time to talk about the parameters of these projects. Here are the parameters of each of the projects. 


• Report/White Paper

APA references

Summarize your business problem/hypothesis

Walk through your method 

5-8 Pages. 

Up to 3 Illustrations @ ¼ page each. 

Up to 1 Illustration @ ½ page. 

PDF 1 Appendix 



• Presentation

Can be in PowerPoint, Prezi or any other presentation tool. You can be creative here and use other tools like blogs, dashboards, etc. but you must have audio 

Presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes – and a minimum of 10 minutes (Remember, these are going on your portfolio, the goal is to gain the attention of potential employers.) 



• Q&A

You must submit 10 potential questions you would receive in a presentation along with your answers in a PDF. 

• Jupyter Notebook or link to your GitHub with your code/dataset.



# Summary of Skills
I used the python environment to perform my exploratory data analysis. I also used the Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy packages and Micosoft's Power BI application for these projects.

# Findings
Each of these projects are domain agnostic, data agnostic, and method agnostic. This means that you can pull data from any domain, analyze it using whatever method you deem worthy, and use data that already exists in any form.

## Project One
Developing and testing three predictive models, the accuracy of the models were good. Only two of the three models had higher accuracy rates. The accuracy rate could have been higher if the dataset had more data. Other than that, this is a great outcome for this project. 

## Project Two
coming soon


# Challenges

## Project One
The only issue is with this dataset is that it has a limited amount of data. This will hinder the scalability of this predictive model in the future of this project.

## Project Two
coming soon


# Conclusion

## Project One
The focus of this project was to see if it is possible to use health insurance data to predict insurance rates based on features. The Polynomial Regression model was the best model that has had the highest accuracy rate. The Polynomial Regression model’s accuracy was 85% and it will be able to predict accurate insurance rates.
